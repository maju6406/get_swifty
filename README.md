# get_swifty

Simple proof of concept of a Puppet Task written in Swift. The task should run natively on any Mac OS version with Swift 2 or higher. It has also been tested on Ubuntu 16.04. For instructions on how to install Swift on Ubuntu read Swift's [Getting Started](https://swift.org/getting-started/#installing-swift) documentation.
